                        <p>A star is an astronomical object made up of plasma and being held together by its own existing gravity and the only close star to earth is the sun. The other stars are only seen at night because of there immense distance they cant easily be seen by the naked eye but they are mostly in groups of constellations and asterisms</p>
                        <p>Stars are formed when there’s a gravitational collapse of a gaseous nebula which is material composed mainly of hydrogen along with helium and traces of heavier elements. Star shines mostly due to thermo nuclear fusion of a gas called hydrogen into helium which happens in its core and when the star’s life ends it explodes and becomes a stellar remnant and if the explosion is large enough it can create a black hole. Stars can form part of a much larger gravitationally bound structure, such as a star cluster  or a galaxy</p>

                        <h2><em>Luminosity</em></h2>
                        <p>The luminosity of a star is the amount of light and other forms of radiant energy it radiates per unit of time. It has units of power. The luminosity of a star is determined by its radius and surface temperature. Many stars do not radiate in a uniform manner across their entire surface. The rapidly rotating star Vega, has a very high energy flux (power per unit area) at its poles than along its equator.</p>
                        <p>Patches of the star's surface with a low temperature and luminosity than the averagely known are identified as starspots. Small dwarf stars such as the in our galaxy Sun generally have essentially featureless disks with only small starspots. Giant stars have larger and more obvious starspots and they show strong stellar limb darkening. Which is the brightness decreases towards the edge of the stellar disk. Red dwarf flare stars such as UV Ceti may possess prominent starspot features.</p>
