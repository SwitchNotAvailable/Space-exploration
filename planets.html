                            <h3>EARTH</h3>
                            <p>Earth is our home planet and it’s the third planet from the sun and it’s about 150 million kilo-metres from the sun and the only known planet that inhabits life because of its unique atmosphere which has oxygen which supports life unlike the other planets. The earth is also known to have one satellite which is natural and that’s the moon</p>
                        
                            <h3>MARS</h3>
                            <p>Mars is a much smaller planet than earth and its about 220 million kilo-metres and it has a unfavourable for human life and on the surface as viewed by the satelites is believed to have many volcanos. Its color red comes from iron oxide commonly known as rust in its soil making it bad for plant growth</p>
                        
                            <h3>JUPITER</h3>
                            <p>Jupiter is the fifth from the sun and its known as the biggest planet in our galaxy made up of gas called hydrogen. This planet lacks a solid surface like most other planets and has a ring around it and it has a strong magnetic field and is believed to have the mass 2.5 times more of all the other planets</p>
                        
                            <h3>SATURN</h3>
                            <p>Saturn has a little difference from Jupiter and it’s the second largest planet and being the sixth from the sun. It has a pale yellow color and that’s because of the ammonia in its atmosphere and it too has an atmosphere consisting of hydrogen and helium. A study shows that Saturn is the only planet less dense than water </p>
                        
                            <h3>VENUS</h3>
                            <p>Venus is a planet 100km away from the sun and it experiences geological activity just like earth and has a thick silicate mantle around an iron core. Amongst all planets venus has the highest temperature of 400 degrees celcius due to the green house gases</p>
                        
                            <h3>URANUS</h3>
                            <p>Uranus is a planet which is purely different from the rest and is believed to be the lightest with the coldest core and gives out the least heat into space and is believed to have about 27 known satelites</p>
                    

                            <h3>NEPTUNE</h3>
                            <p>Neptune is a small planet with a huge mass and more dense and it being more dense means it radiates a lot of heat but not the most because Jupiter does. Neptune has 14 known satelites with Triton being the largest. Neptune is accompanied in its orbit by several minor planets known as Neptune trojans</p>
                        
                            <h3>MECURY</h3>
                            <p>Mercury (0.4 AU (60 million km; 37 million mi) from the Sun) is the closest planet to the Sun and on average, all seven other planets. The smallest planet in the Solar System Mercury has no natural satellites. Besides impact craters, its only known geological features are lobed ridges that were probably produced by a period of contraction early in its history. Mercury's very tenuous atmosphere consists of atoms blasted off its surface by the solar wind. Its relatively large iron core and thin mantle have not yet been adequately explained. Hypotheses include that its outer layers were stripped off by a giant impact, or that it was prevented from fully accreting by the young Sun's energy</p>
